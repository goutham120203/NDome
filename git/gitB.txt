1. Create a New Branch Locally

->git branch <branch_name>  # Create a new branch
->git checkout <branch_name>  # Switch to the new branch
->git checkout -b <branch_name> #Alternatively, you can create and switch in one command

->git push -u origin <branch_name> // git push -u origin <branch_name>
*If the branch is remote and doesnâ€™t exist locally, Git will automatically create a local branch tracking the remote one.
->git fetch origin  # Fetch updates from the remote repository
->git checkout <branch_name>  # Switch to the branch

Alternatively, use:

->git fetch origin <branch_name>:<branch_name>  # Fetch and create the branch locally
->git checkout <branch_name>

2. List All Branches

->git branch #git branch
->git branch -r #Remote branches
->git branch -a All branches (local + remote)
->git branch -all

3. Merge a Branch

-> git merge <branch_name>  //When you want to combine changes from another branch into your current branch
 

4.Delete a Branch

git branch -d <branch_name>  # Safe delete (only deletes if fully merged)
git branch -D <branch_name>  # Force delete

git push origin --delete <branch_name> #Delete a remote branch

** Best Practices
Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before creating a new branch

->git checkout main
->git pull origin main
->git checkout -b <new_branch>

When pushing a branch for the first time, link it to the remote
->git push -u origin <branch_name>
